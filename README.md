Fragmenting Functionality into a Custom Hook: A Justification

Purpose:

The purpose of fragmenting functionality into a custom hook is to improve code organization and readability, promote reusability across multiple components, improve maintainability and testability, and increase developer efficiency and consistency. 

Functionality to Fragment:

We can fragment functionality into a custom hook if it is used or likely to be used in multiple components across the application. 

Reasons for Fragmentation:

There are several reasons for fragmenting functionality into a custom hook:

1. Reusability: By extracting functionality into a custom hook, we can avoid code duplication and ensure consistent implementation across multiple components.

2. Readability and Maintainability: Fragmented code is easier to understand, debug, and update than code that is scattered throughout multiple components.

3. Testability: Custom hooks can be tested independently, simplifying test cases and improving test coverage.

4. Developer Efficiency: Fragmented functionality promotes best practices and encourages adherence to consistent patterns, saving time and effort for developers who won't need to rewrite the same logic for different components.

5. Scalability: Fragmented logic simplifies the process of adding new components or adapting existing ones as the application grows.

In summary, fragmenting functionality into a custom hook is a useful technique for improving code organization, promoting reusability, and simplifying testing and maintenance.
